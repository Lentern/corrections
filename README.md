# Corrections/Additional Information for Lentern Videos
This includes more information and corrections that people may need to know about my videos. YouTube removed annotations a long time ago and there's sadly no other proper way for me to do this.

Have a correction? Tell me in an [issue](https://github.com/Lentern/Corrections/issues) or leave a comment on the video.

## Minecraft Advancement Race... ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7vv567U08E))
* At [19:20](https://youtu.be/v7vv567U08E?t=1160), the chat is supposed to be blurred for a few seconds but it isn't. The only reason that I was blurring the chat in the first place was to reduce confusion about the command blocks involved in this challenge. If you watch the tutorial on how to set it up, you may understand. I just didn't want the casual viewer to be confused why there were a bunch of advancements in the chat already.

## The Secrets of the Minecraft F3 Menu ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4iw6P7Y9Go))
* At [2:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4iw6P7Y9Go&t=156s), the chunk to dig down into is the south-east chunk, you don't need to check all 4 (thanks, [LeftMyGame](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLdXVoLuss7Byg0vVDPDDfQ)) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4iw6P7Y9Go&lc=UgxXUNKD1y9tA-TA2mJ4AaABAg))

## The Fallout of the Minecraft Chat Report System ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnAt-bOY1_8))
* It should be noted that **this video is sort of a reupload.** The original video did not contain the amount of information I was looking for and there were some parts I wanted to change. More information is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxSdi6waQMUD10uN04ajVLNJJzz4CZH84F) and the original video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twnj0t-neqo).
* The text at [14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnAt-bOY1_8&t=862s) should say "Disabling Chat Reporting", I just messed up a text attribute in the editing.

## Minecraft Hardcore - The Beginning ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z222E-7tk0))
* I have made this video unlisted because I don't really feel like carrying this series on. I don't have a whole lot of motivation. I made [a Lentwo video explaining it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiVnrtE2zY) and the [world download is available too](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J5j4CH3Fi1aq5nmoiAnfidTngCB2wy9v).

## The COMPLETE History of Minecraft's Far Lands (2009-2022) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA))
* At [5:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&t=327s), I made a mistake saying that terrain past 32 million was not solid. In this version, it was 16777216 instead because the limit was unintentional. Any boundaries at a clean number like 30 million or 32 million are manually added. The limits at powers of two are typically bugs. I also mentioned this at [5:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&t=301s). (thanks, [Far lands investigator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrMgOfAQSf2cmgf0DVMC3lA) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&lc=UgxphaFi3-4fR2FKpBl4AaABAg)))
* At [8:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&t=488s), "The reason why the Far Lands appear different in the earlier Infdev build was because the interval between sampling points on the Y axis was most likely 4 blocks like on the X and Z axes, and it was only changed to 8 blocks on the Y axis later in Infdev. Noise is only calculated at sampling points and interpolated in between using a quintic equation whose overflowing at the floating-point limit results in another set of Far Lands far beyond 2^63, which I refer to as the Fringe Lands." (thanks, [Allam A.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4B9cOO6KxTDVnnbvRbDJGw) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&lc=Ugz83mbqQ9myVhaOWmx4AaABAg)))
* At [10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&t=618s), "The Far Lands can generate smooth at their initiation if one of the noise generators has an offset that pushes the value at 12550824 just slightly over 2^31, and it is a rather nice effect." (thanks, [Allam A.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4B9cOO6KxTDVnnbvRbDJGw) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&lc=Ugz83mbqQ9myVhaOWmx4AaABAg)))
* At [11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&t=686s), "It can actually be seen when teleporting in the negative direction on only one axis (i. e. -25101648 150 1 or 1 150 -25101648) in the form of minor changes in the artifacts of the Edge Far Lands." (thanks, [Allam A.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4B9cOO6KxTDVnnbvRbDJGw) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&lc=Ugz83mbqQ9myVhaOWmx4AaABAg)))
* I failed to clarify that the stuttering bug was caused by a glitch in the game's rendering engine. I was a little bit to vague when I said "it was a visual glitch." (thanks, [Sam Holland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDAlBb_gXZKOilekvtGjBWg) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&lc=UgzzKxnBXXG3cvBIubt4AaABAg)))

## Beating Minecraft Hardcore Mode with Only Stone Tools (PART 2) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJpjw3mq_SI))
* There was a weird black screen at [9:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJpjw3mq_SI&t=581s) that slipped into the render. This is an error, you can ignore it.

## Beating Minecraft Hardcore Mode with Only Stone Tools (PART 1) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ner8qSl9-jE))
* The microphone audio and the game audio are desynced slightly in this video because I recorded my microphone audio with a separate program. I didn't line up the audio properly and this is my fault.

## This Resource Pack Fixes Minecraft ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8CY5Kjfefg))
* The pack has been rewritten. You should watch [the new video covering it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYeWRhQd9Ro) and you can download it [here](https://github.com/Lentern/Texture-Updates/releases/latest).
